# Source Document Repository

**Source:** `ai-utils/source-document/README.md`

The idea here is to specify a process where copywrighted materials that are used for reference are saved, but are NOT made available publicly.  Basically this is a document repository with a bibliography and copies of source material that are kept private, but are accessible by the AI to do summarization, correlation, and verification at any point.

This sets up a dual repository structure, where one repository (public or private) contains the things that use the source material, and a second repository (always private) contains any copyrighted or proprietary materials that should not be released because we don't have rights to do that.

The task to be done in this directory is to create the appropriate prompts, github MCP or gh cli integrations, and context documents to make sure this can be done relatively easily for a new project.  This could be encapsulated in skills, slash commands, agents, tools, plugins, whatever.  The idea is so that I can apply this pattern easily without having to go through a lot of crap.  Applying this pattern should also include prompts to update the context documents, design documents, etc. of whatever I'm applying it to, so the pattern is applied rigorously.

Associated but separate from this is the idea that research agents find sources that are not available generally on the public internet.  They assess the importance of having access to the full document.  Then they can make a list available to a human agent that may have access to a university library or proprietary research databases who can get that source and add it to the bibliography repository.  There needs to be a set of processes that somehow closes the loop back to the original research agent or task - that the requested resource is now available, and it should be processed to complete the original task.

Another aspect of this is standard processing of all items in the bibliography repository.  For instance, there should be a central index that is maintained that contains all the information needed to produce a proper citation for the source material.  Somewhere there should be stored information about the provenance of the document, how it has been verified or how it could be verified, and releasability.  These items are optionally added by the human agent when they add the source material to the bibliography.  If they are not added, there must be a process to prompt the user for this information and/or automatically extract (and verify) this information before it is used.

Web searches that will be referenced later (or could be referenced later) should be also saved in this bibliography directory.  Optimally a cli tool is used to fetch resources on the web, and all of the returned data is stored in the bibliography directory (modulo things like ads and huge images that are not relevant).  The metadata about the sources should be automatically updated when this process takes place.  Having this as a general tool/process will help to standardize tracking of the provenance of source material.  It will also reduce token usage, as the data is retrieved once, then if it is summarized the summary is saved, and so on.
